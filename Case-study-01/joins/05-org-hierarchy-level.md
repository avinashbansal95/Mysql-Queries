# Employee Hierarchy: Finding Managers and Grand-Managers

## Step 1: Understand the Data Structure

We have the `employees` table:

| emp_id | emp_name | manager_id |
|--------|----------|------------|
| 101 | Alice | NULL |
| 102 | Bob | 101 |
| 103 | Charlie | 101 |
| 104 | David | 102 |
| 105 | Eve | 101 |

* `manager_id` refers to `emp_id` of the manager.
* So:
   * Bob's manager is Alice
   * David's manager is Bob → David's **grand-manager** is Alice

## 🧩 Step 2: Identify Relationships

We need **three levels**:
1. **Employee**
2. **Manager** (of the employee)
3. **Grand-manager** (manager of the manager)

So we need to:
* Join `employees` (as employee) → `employees` (as manager) → `employees` (as grand-manager)

That means: **Triple self-join**

## 🛠️ Step 3: Alias the Table for Clarity

Let's use:
* `e` → employee
* `m` → manager
* `gm` → grand-manager

We want:
* `e.manager_id = m.emp_id` → link employee to manager
* `m.manager_id = gm.emp_id` → link manager to their manager (grand-manager)

## 📌 Step 4: Use `LEFT JOIN` to Preserve Employees with No Manager or Grand-Manager

**Why `LEFT JOIN`?**
* Some employees (like Alice) have **no manager** → `manager_id = NULL`
* Some managers have **no manager** (i.e., CEO) → so no grand-manager

Using `INNER JOIN` would **exclude** them. We want all employees → use `LEFT JOIN`.

## ✅ Final Query:

```sql
SELECT
    e.emp_name AS employee_name,
    m.emp_name AS manager_name,
    gm.emp_name AS gm_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id
LEFT JOIN employees gm ON m.manager_id = gm.emp_id
ORDER BY e.emp_name;
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution

Let's trace a few rows:

### Example 1: David (`emp_id = 104`, `manager_id = 102`)
* `e`: David
* `m`: Bob (`102`)
* `gm`: Alice (`101`, because Bob's `manager_id = 101`)
* ✅ Output: `employee_name = David`, `manager_name = Bob`, `gm_name = Alice`

### Example 2: Bob (`emp_id = 102`, `manager_id = 101`)
* `e`: Bob
* `m`: Alice
* `gm`: Alice's `manager_id = NULL` → no match in `gm`
* So `gm.emp_name = NULL`
* ✅ Output: `employee_name = Bob`, `manager_name = Alice`, `gm_name = NULL`

### Example 3: Alice (`emp_id = 101`, `manager_id = NULL`)
* `e`: Alice
* `m`: `e.manager_id = NULL` → no match → `m.emp_name = NULL`
* `gm`: even if `m` matched, `gm` won't → also `NULL`
* ✅ Output: `employee_name = Alice`, `manager_name = NULL`, `gm_name = NULL`

### Example 4: Frank (`emp_id = 106`, `manager_id = 103`)
* `e`: Frank
* `m`: Charlie (`103`)
* `gm`: Charlie's manager is Alice → `gm.emp_name = Alice`
* ✅ Output: `employee_name = Frank`, `manager_name = Charlie`, `gm_name = Alice`

## 🧪 Sample Output:

| employee_name | manager_name | gm_name |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Alice | NULL | NULL |
| Bob | Alice | NULL |
| Charlie | Alice | NULL |
| David | Bob | Alice |
| Eve | Alice | NULL |
| Frank | Charlie | Alice |
| Grace | Alice | NULL |
| Henry | Alice | NULL |
| Ivy | Charlie | Alice |
| Jack | Bob | Alice |
| Kate | NULL | NULL |
| Leo | Henry | Alice |

## ✅ Why This Works:

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| `LEFT JOIN` twice | Ensures all employees appear, even without manager or grand-manager |
| `ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id` | Correctly links employee to manager |
| `ON m.manager_id = gm.emp_id` | Links manager to their manager |
| `NULL` handling | Automatic with `LEFT JOIN`— no extra logic needed |

## 💡 Interview Tip:

If asked:
**"What if we wanted great-grand-manager?"**

You can say:
> "We'd add another `LEFT JOIN` to go one level up — but for deep hierarchies, it's better to use **recursive CTEs** (in databases that support them like PostgreSQL, SQL Server)."

But in MySQL 8.0+, you **can** use recursive CTEs for unlimited levels.

## 🚀 Bonus: Recursive CTE (Optional, Advanced)

For handling unlimited hierarchy levels, consider using recursive Common Table Expressions in databases that support them.
