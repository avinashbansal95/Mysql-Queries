## Step-by-Step Breakdown: Find the First Hire in Each Department

### **Goal**
For each department, find the **first hired employee** (by the lowest `emp_id`), and show their name and salary.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Tables**

- **departments**
  - `dept_id`, `dept_name`
- **employees**
  - `emp_id`, `emp_name`, `salary`, `manager_id`, `dept_id`

---

### **Step 2: Find the First Hire in Each Department**

```sql
SELECT 
    dept_id, 
    MIN(emp_id) AS first_hire_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
```
- For each `dept_id`, finds the **smallest `emp_id`** (assumed to be the first hire).

---

### **Step 3: Join to Get Employee Details**

```sql
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN (
    ...above subquery...
) min_emp ON e.dept_id = min_emp.dept_id 
         AND e.emp_id = min_emp.first_hire_id
```
- Joins each employee to the "first hire" per department.
- Only the employee whose `emp_id` matches `first_hire_id` for their department is kept.

---

### **Step 4: Join to Get Department Name**

```sql
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
```
- Adds the department name for each result.

---

### **Step 5: Select and Order Columns**

```sql
SELECT 
    d.dept_name,
    e.emp_name,
    e.salary
ORDER BY d.dept_name;
```
- Shows department name, employee name, and salary.
- Orders alphabetically by department.

### **Sample Output (Based on Your Data)**

| dept_name   | emp_name | salary  |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Engineering | Alice    | 70000   |
| Finance     | Kate     | 53000   |
| HR          | Grace    | 58000   |
| Marketing   | Frank    | 50000   |
| Sales       | Charlie  | 65000   |

---

### **Summary Table**

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | Find first hire (`MIN(emp_id)`) for each department |
| 2    | Join to get employee details for those first hires |
| 3    | Join to get department names |
| 4    | Select and order the results |

---

**This approach ensures you get the very first employee (by `emp_id`) for every department, along with their name and salary.**
