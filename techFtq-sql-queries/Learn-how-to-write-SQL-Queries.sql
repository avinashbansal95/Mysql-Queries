1. Write a SQL Query to fetch all the duplicate records in a table.

create table users
(
user_id int primary key,
user_name varchar(30) not null,
email varchar(50));

insert into users values
(1, 'Sumit', 'sumit@gmail.com'),
(2, 'Reshma', 'reshma@gmail.com'),
(3, 'Farhana', 'farhana@gmail.com'),
(4, 'Robin', 'robin@gmail.com'),
(5, 'Robin', 'robin@gmail.com');


select * from (select row_number() over(partition by user_name)as num , u.* from users u) x where x.num > 1;


2. Write a SQL query to fetch the second last record from employee table.


select emp_id, emp_name, dept_name, salary
from (
select *,
row_number() over (order by emp_id desc) as rn
from employee e) x
where x.rn = 2;


3. Write a SQL query to display only the details of employees who either earn the highest salary or the lowest salary in each department from the employee table.




1) SELECT e.*
FROM employee e
JOIN (
    SELECT dept_name,
           MAX(salary) AS maxSal,
           MIN(salary) AS minSal
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY dept_name
) x
  ON e.dept_name = x.dept_name
WHERE e.salary = x.maxSal 
   OR e.salary = x.minSal;


2) SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept_name) AS max_salary,
           MIN(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept_name) AS min_salary
    FROM employee
) x
WHERE salary = max_salary OR salary = min_salary
ORDER BY dept_name, salary;

4) from the doctors table, fetch the details of doctors who work in the same hospital but in different speciality.

--Table Structure:

drop table doctors;
create table doctors
(
id int primary key,
name varchar(50) not null,
speciality varchar(100),
hospital varchar(50),
city varchar(50),
consultation_fee int
);

insert into doctors values
(1, 'Dr. Shashank', 'Ayurveda', 'Apollo Hospital', 'Bangalore', 2500),
(2, 'Dr. Abdul', 'Homeopathy', 'Fortis Hospital', 'Bangalore', 2000),
(3, 'Dr. Shwetha', 'Homeopathy', 'KMC Hospital', 'Manipal', 1000),
(4, 'Dr. Murphy', 'Dermatology', 'KMC Hospital', 'Manipal', 1500),
(5, 'Dr. Farhana', 'Physician', 'Gleneagles Hospital', 'Bangalore', 1700),
(6, 'Dr. Maryam', 'Physician', 'Gleneagles Hospital', 'Bangalore', 1500);


--Solution:

select d1.name, d1.speciality,d1.hospital
from doctors d1
join doctors d2
on d1.hospital = d2.hospital and d1.speciality <> d2.speciality
and d1.id <> d2.id;



--Sub Question:

Now find the doctors who work in same hospital irrespective of their speciality.

--Solution:

select d1.name, d1.speciality,d1.hospital
from doctors d1
join doctors d2
on d1.hospital = d2.hospital
and d1.id <> d2.id;


5. From the login_details table, fetch the users who logged in consecutively 3 or more times.
Table Name: LOGIN_DETAILS

Approach: We need to fetch users who have appeared 3 or more times consecutively in login details table. There is a window function which can be used to fetch data from the following record. Use that window function to compare the user name in current row with user name in the next row and in the row following the next row. If it matches then fetch those records.


--Table Structure:

drop table login_details;
create table login_details(
login_id int primary key,
user_name varchar(50) not null,
login_date date);

delete from login_details;
insert into login_details values
(101, 'Michael', current_date),
(102, 'James', current_date),
(103, 'Stewart', current_date+1),
(104, 'Stewart', current_date+1),
(105, 'Stewart', current_date+1),
(106, 'Michael', current_date+2),
(107, 'Michael', current_date+2),
(108, 'Stewart', current_date+3),
(109, 'Stewart', current_date+3),
(110, 'James', current_date+4),
(111, 'James', current_date+4),
(112, 'James', current_date+5),
(113, 'James', current_date+6);



6. From the students table, write a SQL query to interchange the adjacent student names.

-- Query 6:

From the students table, write a SQL query to interchange the adjacent student names.

Note: If there are no adjacent student then the student name should stay the same.

--Table Structure:

drop table students;
create table students
(
id int primary key,
student_name varchar(50) not null
);
insert into students values
(1, 'James'),
(2, 'Michael'),
(3, 'George'),
(4, 'Stewart'),
(5, 'Robin');


SELECT s.*,
    CASE 
        WHEN id % 2 <> 0 
            THEN COALESCE(LEAD(student_name) OVER (ORDER BY id), student_name)
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 
            THEN COALESCE(LAG(student_name) OVER (ORDER BY id), student_name)
    END AS new_name
FROM students s;



7. From the weather table, fetch all the records when London had extremely cold temperature for 3 consecutive days or more.


Note: Weather is considered to be extremely cold then its temperature is less than zero.

--Table Structure:

drop table weather;
create table weather
(
id int,
city varchar(50),
temperature int,
day date
);
delete from weather;
insert into weather values
(1, 'London', -1, to_date('2021-01-01','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(2, 'London', -2, to_date('2021-01-02','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(3, 'London', 4, to_date('2021-01-03','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(4, 'London', 1, to_date('2021-01-04','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(5, 'London', -2, to_date('2021-01-05','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(6, 'London', -5, to_date('2021-01-06','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(7, 'London', -7, to_date('2021-01-07','yyyy-mm-dd')),
(8, 'London', 5, to_date('2021-01-08','yyyy-mm-dd'));



select id, city, temperature, day
from (
    select *,
        case when temperature < 0
              and lead(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lead(temperature,2) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        when temperature < 0
              and lead(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lag(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        when temperature < 0
              and lag(temperature) over(order by day) < 0
              and lag(temperature,2) over(order by day) < 0
        then 'Y'
        end as flag
    from weather) x
where x.flag = 'Y';




8. From the following 3 tables (event_category, physician_speciality, patient_treatment), write a SQL query to get the histogram of specialties of the unique physicians who have done the procedures but never did prescribe anything.
Table Name: EVENT_CATEGORY, PHYSICIAN_SPECIALITY, PATIENT_TREATMENT

Approach: Using the patient treatment and event category table, identify all the physicians who have done “Prescription”. Have this recorded in a sub query. 

Then in the main query join the patient treatment, event category and physician speciality table to identify all the physician who have done “Procedure”. From these physicians, remove those physicians you got from sub query to return the physicians who have done Procedure but never did Prescription.

--Table Structure:

drop table event_category;
create table event_category
(
  event_name varchar(50),
  category varchar(100)
);

drop table physician_speciality;
create table physician_speciality
(
  physician_id int,
  speciality varchar(50)
);

drop table patient_treatment;
create table patient_treatment
(
  patient_id int,
  event_name varchar(50),
  physician_id int
);


insert into event_category values ('Chemotherapy','Procedure');
insert into event_category values ('Radiation','Procedure');
insert into event_category values ('Immunosuppressants','Prescription');
insert into event_category values ('BTKI','Prescription');
insert into event_category values ('Biopsy','Test');


insert into physician_speciality values (1000,'Radiologist');
insert into physician_speciality values (2000,'Oncologist');
insert into physician_speciality values (3000,'Hermatologist');
insert into physician_speciality values (4000,'Oncologist');
insert into physician_speciality values (5000,'Pathologist');
insert into physician_speciality values (6000,'Oncologist');


insert into patient_treatment values (1,'Radiation', 1000);
insert into patient_treatment values (2,'Chemotherapy', 2000);
insert into patient_treatment values (1,'Biopsy', 1000);
insert into patient_treatment values (3,'Immunosuppressants', 2000);
insert into patient_treatment values (4,'BTKI', 3000);
insert into patient_treatment values (5,'Radiation', 4000);
insert into patient_treatment values (4,'Chemotherapy', 2000);
insert into patient_treatment values (1,'Biopsy', 5000);
insert into patient_treatment values (6,'Chemotherapy', 6000);


select * from patient_treatment;
select * from event_category;
select * from physician_speciality;

-- Solution:
select ps.speciality, count(1) as speciality_count
from patient_treatment pt
join event_category ec on ec.event_name = pt.event_name
join physician_speciality ps on ps.physician_id = pt.physician_id
where ec.category = 'Procedure'
and pt.physician_id not in (select pt2.physician_id
							from patient_treatment pt2
							join event_category ec on ec.event_name = pt2.event_name
							where ec.category in ('Prescription'))
group by ps.speciality;


9. Find the top 2 accounts with the maximum number of unique patients on a monthly basis.

Note: Prefer the account if with the least value in case of same number of unique patients

--Table Structure:

drop table patient_logs;
create table patient_logs
(
  account_id int,
  date date,
  patient_id int
);

insert into patient_logs values (1, to_date('02-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 100);
insert into patient_logs values (1, to_date('27-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 200);
insert into patient_logs values (2, to_date('01-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 300);
insert into patient_logs values (2, to_date('21-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 400);
insert into patient_logs values (2, to_date('21-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 300);
insert into patient_logs values (2, to_date('01-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 500);
insert into patient_logs values (3, to_date('20-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 400);
insert into patient_logs values (1, to_date('04-03-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 500);
insert into patient_logs values (3, to_date('20-01-2020','dd-mm-yyyy'), 450);

select a.month, a.account_id, a.no_of_unique_patients
from (
		select x.month, x.account_id, no_of_unique_patients,
			row_number() over (partition by x.month order by x.no_of_unique_patients desc) as rn
		from (
				select pl.month, pl.account_id, count(1) as no_of_unique_patients
				from (select distinct to_char(date,'month') as month, account_id, patient_id
						from patient_logs) pl
				group by pl.month, pl.account_id) x
     ) a
where a.rn < 3;
